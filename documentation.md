# Cross-Compiling C++ Code for ARM64

This guide explains the process of cross-compiling C++ code for ARM64, generating shared objects (.so), and compiling a main program that includes the cross-compiled shared object.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Cross-compilation toolchain for ARM64 installed.
- C++ source code files to cross-compile.
- Main C++ source code file that includes the generated shared object.
- Basic knowledge of the cross-compilation process.
